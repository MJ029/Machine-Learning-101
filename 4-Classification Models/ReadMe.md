# Classification Models

### 1. What is Classification Models ?
- ***Classification*** is a technique where we categorize data into a given number of classes. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under.
- Classification can be performed on ***structured*** or ***unstructured data***. 
- In statistics and machine learning, ***classification*** is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is well-known.
- A simple example of Classification is ***pattern recognition***.
- In machine learning terminology, classification is considered an instance of supervised learning
  - **Ex:** learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available
- The other hand corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as ***clustering***, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent ***similarity or distance***.
